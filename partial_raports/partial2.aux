\@writefile{lof}{\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {1}{\ignorespaces Model of an RCL polymer for chromatin repair simulations. Two random breaks are induced with a deterministic inter-break genomic distance between them. Random cross-links are built uniformly over all combinations of non-neighbor monomers. In the break moment, the cross-links in damage foci (e.g. the CL in monomer $B_2$) might be removed along with the broken bonds. Excluded volume interactions can also be added in the form of a repulsive harmonic potential in the disconnected monomers, simulating the reported chromatin expansion induced just after the DSBs. Finally, repair occurs when two separated neighbors meet at a distance inferior to an encounter distance $\varepsilon $.}}{4}}
